    <h2>The Digital Divide</h2>
    
    <h3>By Christopher Gaona</h3>
    <p>The digital divide has created a gap in the world for a long time now and it 
    still continues years after the World Wide Web has been out. Technology 
    ownership has been growing rapidly, especially in the United States, but there
    is still a large population that is still affected by this.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <b>Lower-Income Americans</b>
            Around 3 in 10 adults with a household income below $30,000 a year
            don't own a smartphone. And more than 4 in 10 adults don't have home
            internet service or a personal computer.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Relying on Smartphones</b>
            A lot of lower-income Americans are relying on smartphones to do 
            task that someone usually does on a computer, laptop, or tablet.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Homework Gap</b>
            This gap also affects kids who have homework that is online as many
            school-age children from lower-income households do not have internet
            at home.
        </li>
    </ul>
